# Arithmetic Expression
Let's explore some simple arithmetic expressions using Python.

# Multipling and Adding Numbers
a = 5
b = 10
multiply_result = a * b
add_result = a + b
print(multiply_result)
print(add_result)

# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 120
hours = minutes / 60
print(minutes, "minutes is equal to", hours, "hours.")


# Objectives
- Learn about data science languages and libraries.
- Explore various data science tools.
- Practice arithmetic expressions in Python.
